\section{Introduction}

In cosmology (or to be more specific, {\em cosmography,\/} the
measurement of the Universe) there are many ways to specify the
distance between two points, because in the expanding Universe, the
distances between comoving objects are constantly changing, and
Earth-bound observers look back in time as they look out in distance.
The unifying aspect is that all distance measures somehow measure the
separation between events on radial null trajectories, ie,
trajectories of photons which terminate at the observer.

In this note, formulae for many different cosmological distance
measures are provided.  I treat the concept of ``distance measure''
very liberally, so, for instance, the lookback time and comoving
volume are both considered distance measures.  The bibliography of
source material can be consulted for many of the derivations; this is
merely a ``cheat sheet.''  $C$ routines (KR) which compute all of
these distance measures are available from the author upon request.
Comments and corrections are highly appreciated, as are
acknowledgments in research that makes use of this summary or code.


\section{Cosmographic parameters}

The {\em Hubble constant\/} $H_0$ is the constant of proportionality
between recession speed $v$ and distance $d$ in the expanding
Universe;
\begin{equation}
v=H_0\, d
\end{equation}
The subscripted ``0'' refers to the present epoch because in general
$H$ changes with time.  The dimensions of $H_0$ are inverse time, but
it is usually written
\begin{equation}
H_0=100\,h~{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}
\end{equation}
where $h$ is a dimensionless number parameterizing our ignorance.  The
inverse of the Hubble constant is the {\em Hubble time\/} $t_H$
\begin{equation}
t_H\equiv\frac{1}{H_0}
= 9.78\times10^9\,h^{-1}~{\rm yr}= 3.09\times10^{17}\,h^{-1}~{\rm s}
\end{equation}
and the speed of light $c$ times the Hubble time is the {\em Hubble
distance\/} $D_H$
\begin{equation}
D_H\equiv\frac{c}{H_0}
= 3000\,h^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}= 9.26\times10^{25}\,h^{-1}~{\rm m}
\end{equation}
These quantities set the scale of the Universe, and often cosmologists
work in geometric units with $c=t_H=D_H=1$.

The mass density $\rho$ of the Universe and the value of the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ are dynamical properties of the
Universe, affecting the time evolution of the metric, but in these
notes we will treat them as purely kinematic parameters.  They can be
made into dimensionless density parameters $\Omega_M$ and
$\Omega_{\Lambda}$ by
\begin{equation}
\Omega_M\equiv\frac{8\pi\,G\,\rho_0}{3\,H_0^2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\Lambda}\equiv\frac{\Lambda\,c^2}{3\,H_0^2}
\end{equation}
(Peebles, 1993, pp~310--313), where the subscripted ``0''s indicate
that the quantities (which in general evolve with time) are to be
evaluated at the present epoch.  A third density parameter $\Omega_k$
measures the ``curvature of space'' and can be defined by the relation
\begin{equation}
\Omega_M+\Omega_{\Lambda}+\Omega_k= 1
\end{equation}
These parameters totally determine the geometry of the Universe if it
is homogeneous, isotropic, and matter-dominated.  By the way, the
critical density $\Omega=1$ corresponds to $7.5\times
10^{21}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}\,D_H^{-3}$, where $M_{\odot}$ is the mass
of the Sun.

Most theorists believe that it is in some sense ``unlikely'' that all
three of these density parameters be of the same order, and we know
that $\Omega_M$ is significantly larger than zero, so many guess that
$(\Omega_M,\Omega_{\Lambda},\Omega_k)=(1,0,0)$, with
$(\Omega_M,1-\Omega_M,0)$ and $(\Omega_M,0,1-\Omega_M)$ tied for
second place.  If $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0$, then the {\em deceleration
parameter\/} $q_0$ is just half $\Omega_M$, otherwise $q_0$ is not
such a useful parameter.  When I perform cosmographic calculations and
I want to cover all the bases, I use the three world models
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
name & $\Omega_M$ & $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ \\ \hline
Einstein-de Sitter & 1 & 0 \\
low density & 0.05 & 0 \\
high lambda & 0.2 & 0.8 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
These three models push the observational limits.


\section{Redshift}

The {\em redshift\/} $z$ of an object is the fractional doppler shift
of its emitted light resulting from radial motion
\begin{equation}
z\equiv \frac{\nu_e}{\nu_o}-1 = \frac{\lambda_o}{\lambda_e}-1
\end{equation}
where $\nu_o$ and $\lambda_o$ are the observed frequency and
wavelength, and $\nu_e$ and $\lambda_e$ are the emitted.  Redshift is
related to radial velocity $v$ by
\begin{equation}
1+z = \sqrt{\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the speed of light.  Many feel that it is wrong to view
relativistic redshifts as velocities (eg, Harrison, 1993), but I
simply do not agree.  The difference between an object's measured
redshift and its {\em cosmological redshift\/} is due to its (radial)
{\em peculiar velocity;\/} ie, we define the cosmological redshift as
that part of the redshift due solely to the expansion of the Universe,
or {\em Hubble flow.\/} For small $v/c$, or small distance $d$, in the
expanding Universe, the velocity is linearly proportional to the
distance (and all the distance measures, eg, angular diameter
distance, luminosity distance, etc, converge)
\begin{equation}
z \approx \frac{v}{c} = \frac{d}{D_H}
\end{equation}
where $D_H$ is the Hubble distance (see above).  But this is {\em only
true for small redshifts!\/}

(It is very important to note that galaxy redshift surveys, when
presenting redshifts as radial velocities, {\em always\/} use the
non-relativistic approximation $v=c\,z$, even when it is {\em not\/}
appropriate physically; eg, Fairall, 1992.)

In terms of cosmography, the cosmological redshift is directly related
to the scale factor $a(t)$, or the ``size'' of the Universe.  For an
object at redshift $z$
\begin{equation}
1+z = \frac{a(t_o)}{a(t_e)}
\end{equation}
where $a(t_o)$ is the size of the Universe at the time the light from
the object is observed, and $a(t_e)$ is the size at the time it was
emitted.

Redshift is almost always determined with respect to us (or the frame
centered on us but stationary with respect to the microwave
background), but it is possible to define the redshift $z_{12}$
between objects 1 and 2, both of which are cosmologically redshifted
relative to us: the redshift $z_{12}$ of an object at redshift $z_2$
relative to a hypothetical observer at redshift $z_1<z_2$ is given by
\begin{equation}
1+z_{12} = \frac{a(t_1)}{a(t_2)} = \frac{1+z_2}{1+z_1}
\end{equation}


\section{Comoving distance (line-of-sight)}

A small {\em comoving distance\/} $\delta D_C$ between two nearby
objects in the Universe is the distance between them which remains
constant with epoch if the two objects are moving with the Hubble
flow.  In other words, it is the distance between them which would be
measured with rulers at the time they are being observed (the {\em
proper distance}) divided by the ratio of the scale factor of the
Universe then to now.  In other words the proper distance multiplied
by $(1+z)$.  The total line-of-sight comoving distance $D_C$ from us
to a distant object is computed by integrating the infinitesimal
$\delta D_C$ contributions between nearby events along the radial ray
from $z=0$ to the object.

Following Peebles (1993, pp~310--321) (who calls the transverse
comoving distance by the confusing name ``angular size distance,''
which is {\em not\/} the same as ``angular diameter distance''
introduced below), we define the function
\begin{equation}
E(z)\equiv\sqrt{\Omega_M\,(1+z)^3+\Omega_k\,(1+z)^2+\Omega_{\Lambda}}
\end{equation}
which is proportional to the time derivative of the logarithm of the
scale factor (ie, $\dot{a}(t)/a(t)$), with $z$ redshift and the three
density parameters defined as above.  (For this reason,
$H(z)=H_0\,E(z)$ is the Hubble constant as measured by a hypothetical
astronomer working at redshift $z$.)  Since $dz=da$, $dz/E(z)$ is
proportional to the time-of-flight of a photon traveling across the
redshift interval $dz$, divided by the scale factor at that time.
Since the speed of light is constant, this is a proper distance
divided by the scale factor, which is the definition of a comoving
distance.  The total line-of-sight comoving distance is then given by
integrating these contributions, or
\begin{equation}
D_C = D_H\,\int_0^z\frac{dz'}{E(z')}
\end{equation}
where $D_H$ is the Hubble distance defined above.

In some sense the line-of-sight comoving distance is the fundamental
distance measure in cosmography since, as will be seen below, all
others are quite simply derived in terms of it.  The line-of-sight
comoving distance between two nearby events (ie, close in redshift or
distance) is the distance which we would measure locally between the
events today if those two points were locked into the Hubble flow.  It
is the correct distance measure for measuring aspects of large-scale
structure imprinted on the Hubble flow, eg, distances between
``walls.''


\section{Comoving distance (transverse)}

The comoving distance between two events at the same redshift or
distance but separated on the sky by some angle $\delta\theta$ is
$D_M\,\delta\theta$ and the transverse comoving distance $D_M$
(so-denoted for a reason explained below) is simply related to the
line-of-sight comoving distance $D_C$:
\begin{equation}
D_M = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
D_H\,\frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_k}}\,\sinh\left[\sqrt{\Omega_k}\,D_C/D_H\right] & {\rm for}~\Omega_k>0 \\
D_C & {\rm for}~\Omega_k=0 \\
D_H\,\frac{1}{\sqrt{|\Omega_k|}}\,\sin\left[\sqrt{|\Omega_k|}\,D_C/D_H\right] & {\rm for}~\Omega_k<0
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
where the trigonometric functions $\sinh$ and $\sin$ account for what
is called ``the curvature of space.''  (Space curvature depends on the
particular coordinate system chosen, so it is not intrinsic; a change
of coordinates makes space flat; the only intrinsic curvature is
space-time curvature, which is related to the local mass-energy
density or really stress-energy tensor.)  For $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0$,
there is an analytic solution to the equations
\begin{equation}
D_M=D_H\,\frac{2\,[2-\Omega_M\,(1-z)-
(2-\Omega_M)\,\sqrt{1+\Omega_M\,z}]}{\Omega_M^2\,(1+z)}
~{\rm for}~\Omega_{\Lambda}=0
\end{equation}
(Weinberg, 1972, p.~485; Peebles, 1993, pp~320--321).  Some (eg,
Weedman, 1986, pp~59--60) call this distance measure ``proper
distance,'' which, though common usage, is bad style.\footnote{The
word ``proper'' has a specific use in relativity.  The {\em proper
time\/} between two nearby events is the time delay between the events
in the frame in which they take place at the same location, and the
{\em proper distance\/} between two nearby events is the distance
between them in the frame in which they happen at the same time.  It
is the distance measured by a ruler at the time of observation.  The
transverse comoving distance $D_M$ is {\em not\/} a proper
distance---it is a proper distance divided by a ratio of scale
factors.}

(Although these notes follow the Peebles derivation, there is a
qualitatively distinct method using what is known as the {\em
development angle\/} $\chi$, which increases as the Universe evolves.
This method is preferred by relativists such as Misner, Thorne \&
Wheeler 1973, pp~782--785).

The comoving distance happens to be equivalent to the {\em proper
motion distance\/} (hence the name $D_M$), defined as the ratio of the
actual transverse velocity (in distance over time) of an object to its
proper motion (in radians per unit time) (Weinberg, 1972,
pp~423--424).  The proper motion distance is plotted in
Figure~\ref{propmotdis}.  Proper motion distance is used, for example,
in computing radio jet velocities from knot motion.


\section{Angular diameter distance}

The {\em angular diameter distance\/} $D_A$ is defined as the ratio of
an object's physical transverse size to its angular size (in radians).
It is used to convert angular separations in telescope images into
proper separations at the source.  It is famous for not increasing
indefinitely as $z\rightarrow\infty$; it turns over at $z\sim 1$ and
thereafter more distant objects actually appear larger in angular
size.  Angular diameter distance is related to the transverse comoving
distance by
\begin{equation}
D_A = \frac{D_M}{1+z}
\end{equation}
(Weinberg, 1972, pp~421--424; Weedman, 1986, pp~65--67; Peebles,
1993, pp~325--327).  The angular diameter distance is plotted in
Figure~\ref{angdidis}.

There is also an angular diameter distance $D_{A12}$ between two
objects at redshifts $z_1$ and $z_2$, frequently used in gravitational
lensing.  It is {\em not\/} found by subtracting the two individual
angular diameter distances!  The correct formula, for $\Omega_k\geq
0$, is
\begin{equation}
D_{A12}= \frac{1}{1+z_2}\,\left[
 D_{M2}\,\sqrt{1+\Omega_k\,\frac{D_{M1}^2}{D_H^2}}
 - D_{M1}\,\sqrt{1+\Omega_k\,\frac{D_{M2}^2}{D_H^2}}\right]
\end{equation}
where $D_{M1}$ and $D_{M2}$ are the transverse comoving distances to
$z_1$ and $z_2$, $D_H$ is the Hubble distance, and $\Omega_k$ is the
curvature density parameter (Peebles, 1993, pp~336--337).
Unfortunately, the above formula is {\em not correct\/} for
$\Omega_k<0$ (Phillip Helbig, 1998, private communication).


\section{Luminosity distance}

The {\em luminosity distance\/} $D_L$ is defined by the relationship
between bolometric (ie, integrated over all frequencies) flux $S$
and bolometric luminosity $L$:
\begin{equation}
D_L\equiv \sqrt{\frac{L}{4\pi\,S}}
\end{equation}
It turns out that this is related to the transverse comoving distance
and angular diameter distance by
\begin{equation}
D_L = (1+z)\,D_M = (1+z)^2\,D_A
\end{equation}
(Weinberg, 1972, pp~420--424; Weedman, 1986, pp~60--62).  The latter
relation follows from the fact that the surface brightness of a
receding object is reduced by a factor $(1+z)^{-4}$, and the angular
area goes down as $D_A^{-2}$.  The luminosity distance is plotted in
Figure~\ref{lumdis}.

If the concern is not with bolometric quantities but rather with
differential flux $S_{\nu}$ and luminosity $L_{\nu}$, as is usually
the case in astronomy, then a correction, the {\em k-correction,\/}
must be applied to the flux or luminosity because the redshifted
object is emitting flux in a different band than that in which you are
observing.  The k-correction depends on the spectrum of the object in
question, and is unnecessary only if the object has spectrum
$\nu\,L_{\nu}={\rm constant}$.  For any other spectrum the
differential flux $S_{\nu}$ is related to the differential luminosity
$L_{\nu}$ by
\begin{equation}
S_{\nu} = (1+z)\,\frac{L_{(1+z)\nu}}{L_{\nu}}\,\frac{L_{\nu}}{4\pi\,D_L^2}
\end{equation}
where $z$ is the redshift, the ratio of luminosities equalizes the
difference in flux between the observed and emitted bands, and the
factor of $(1+z)$ accounts for the redshifting of the bandwidth.
Similarly, for differential flux per unit wavelength,
\begin{equation}
S_{\lambda} = \frac{1}{(1+z)}\,\frac{L_{\lambda/(1+z)}}{L_{\lambda}}\,
\frac{L_{\lambda}}{4\pi\,D_L^2}
\end{equation}
(Peebles, 1993, pp~330--331; Weedman, 1986, pp~60--62).  In this
author's opinion, the most natural flux unit is differential flux per
unit log frequency or log wavelength
$\nu\,S_{\nu}=\lambda\,S_{\lambda}$ for which there is no redshifting
of the bandpass so
\begin{equation}
\nu\,S_{\nu} = \frac{\nu_e\,L_{\nu_e}}{4\pi\,D_L^2}
\end{equation}
where $\nu_e=(1+z)\nu$ is the emitted frequency.

The {\em distance modulus\/} $DM$ is defined by
\begin{equation}
DM\equiv 5\,\log \left(\frac{D_L}{10~{\rm pc}}\right)
\end{equation}
because it is the magnitude difference between an object's observed
bolometric flux and what it would be if it were at $10~{\rm pc}$
(don't ask me, ask an astronomer!).  The distance modulus is plotted
in Figure~\ref{distmod}.  The absolute magnitude $M$ is the
astronomer's measure of luminosity, defined to be the apparent
magnitude the object in question would have if it were at 10~pc, so
\begin{equation}
m=M+DM+K
\end{equation}
where $K$ is the k-correction
\begin{equation}
K = -2.5\,\log\left[(1+z)\,\frac{L_{(1+z)\nu}}{L_{\nu}}\right]=
-2.5\,\log \left[\frac{1}{(1+z)}\,\frac{L_{\lambda/(1+z)}}{L_{\lambda}}\right]
\end{equation}
(eg., Oke \& Sandage, 1968).


\section{Parallax distance}

If it was possible to measure parallaxes for high redshift objects,
the distance so measured would be the {\em parallax distance\/} $D_P$
(Weinberg, 1972, pp~418--420).  It may be possible,
one day, to measure parallaxes to distant galaxies using gravitational
lensing, although in these cases, a modified parallax distance is used
which takes into account the redshifts of both the source and the
lens (Schneider, Ehlers \& Falco, 1992, pp~508--509), a discussion of
which is beyond the scope of these notes.


\section{Comoving volume}

The {\em comoving volume\/} $V_C$ is the volume measure in which
number densities of non-evolving objects locked into Hubble flow are
constant with redshift.  It is the proper volume times three factors
of the relative scale factor now to then, or $(1+z)^3$.  Since the
derivative of comoving distance with redshift is $1/E(z)$ (defined
above), the angular diameter distance converts a solid angle $d\Omega$
into a proper area, and two factors of $(1+z)$ convert a proper area
into a comoving area, the comoving volume element in solid angle
$d\Omega$ and redshift interval $dz$ is
\begin{equation}
dV_C= D_H\,\frac{(1+z)^2\,D_A^2}{E(z)}\,d\Omega\,dz
\end{equation}
where $D_A$ is the angular diameter distance at redshift $z$ and
$E(z)$ is defined above (Weinberg, 1972, p.~486; Peebles, 1993,
pp~331--333).  The comoving volume element is plotted in
Figure~\ref{dcomvoldz}.  The integral of the comoving volume element
from the present to redshift $z$ gives the total comoving volume,
all-sky, out to redshift $z$
\begin{equation}
V_C = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
  \left(\frac{4\pi\,D_H^3}{2\,\Omega_k}\right)\,
  \left[\frac{D_M}{D_H}\,
  \sqrt{1+\Omega_k\,\frac{D_M^2}{D_H^2}}
  -\frac{1}{\sqrt{|\Omega_k|}}\,
  {\rm arcsinh}\left(\sqrt{|\Omega_k|}\,\frac{D_M}{D_H}\right)\right]
  & {\rm for}~\Omega_k>0 \\
  \frac{4\pi}{3}\,D_M^3
  & {\rm for}~\Omega_k=0 \\
  \left(\frac{4\pi\,D_H^3}{2\,\Omega_k}\right)\,
  \left[\frac{D_M}{D_H}\,
  \sqrt{1+\Omega_k\,\frac{D_M^2}{D_H^2}}
  -\frac{1}{\sqrt{|\Omega_k|}}\,
  {\rm arcsin}\left(\sqrt{|\Omega_k|}\,\frac{D_M}{D_H}\right)\right]
  & {\rm for}~\Omega_k<0
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
(Carrol, Press \& Turner, 1992), where $D_H^3$ is sometimes called the
{\em Hubble volume.\/} The comoving volume element and its integral
are both used frequently in predicting number counts or luminosity
densities.


\section{Lookback time}

The {\em lookback time\/} $t_L$ to an object is the difference between
the age $t_o$ of the Universe now (at observation) and the age $t_e$
of the Universe at the time the photons were emitted (according to the
object).  It is used to predict properties of high-redshift objects
with evolutionary models, such as passive stellar evolution for
galaxies.  Recall that $E(z)$ is the time derivative of the logarithm
of the scale factor $a(t)$; the scale factor is proportional to
$(1+z)$, so the product $(1+z)\,E(z)$ is proportional to the
derivative of $z$ with respect to the lookback time, or
\begin{equation}
t_L = t_H\,\int_0^z \frac{dz'}{(1+z')\,E(z')}
\end{equation}
(Peebles, 1993, pp~313--315; Kolb \& Turner 1990, pp~52--56, give
some analytic solutions to this equation, but they are concerned with
the age $t(z)$, so they integrate from $z$ to $\infty$).  The lookback
time is plotted in Figure~\ref{lookback}.


\section{Probability of intersecting objects}
\label{sec:optdepth}

Given a population of objects with comoving number density $n(z)$
(number per unit volume) and cross section $\sigma(z)$ (area), what is
the incremental probability $dP$ that a line of sight will intersect
one of the objects in redshift interval $dz$ at redshift $z$?
Questions of this form are asked frequently in the study of QSO
absorption lines or pencil-beam redshift surveys.  The answer is
\begin{equation}
dP=n(z)\,\sigma(z)\,D_H\,\frac{(1+z)^2}{E(z)}\,dz
\end{equation}
(Peebles, 1993, pp~323--325).  The dimensionless differential
intersection probability is plotted in Figure~\ref{doptdepthdz}.
